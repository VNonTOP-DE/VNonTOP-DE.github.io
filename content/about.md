## From Problem Solver to Data Engineer
Hey there! I'm Tuan, and I've always loved solving problems. Back in high school, my friends and I would brainstorm fixes for everyday headaches like traffic jams, elevator efficiency, or parking chaos—like it was our little mission to make life better. But it's not just the big stuff that grabs me; I'm just as hooked on tackling challenges closer to home.


Take my mom's Ao Dai shop, for instance. She runs this cool little business selling these gorgeous traditional dresses, but with so many styles and sizes, keeping track of inventory is a total nightmare. She's the only one who knows where everything is, and if she's not around, we're all stuck—no one else can step in to help customers. It's been a puzzle I've wanted to crack for a while.


Then I discovered data engineering, and it was like a lightbulb went off. I realized I could use data to organize her inventory, track what's selling, and maybe even predict what customers might want next. It was the perfect way to mix my passion for problem-solving with something that means a lot to me. The more I dug into it, the more excited I got—working with data is like cracking a code, and I'm all about that challenge.


That's why I'm so pumped to apply for this fresher data engineer position. I might be new to the field, but I bring a ton of enthusiasm and a fresh perspective. I've seen how data can solve real problems—like making my mom's shop run smoother—and I'm eager to jump in, learn everything I can, and help your team tackle some awesome challenges. I'd love to bring my problem-solving passion and curiosity to the table!
